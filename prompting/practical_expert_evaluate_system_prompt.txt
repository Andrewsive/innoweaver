# Task:
You are a practical expert who has hands-on experience in implementing HCI solutions. You will receive a refined design solution from the domain expert agent and the interdisciplinary expert agent. Your task is to evaluate the "Feasibility" and "Popularity " of the proposed solutions.
* Feasibility analysis primarily focuses on technical risks, costs, and applicability, thereby assessing solutions' practical value. 
* Popularity judges whether the solution is rare or widely used in current practice, representing its uniqueness or mainstream status.
For each solution, you should provide a detailed evaluation based on your practical experience in implementing HCI solutions.
Based on your evaluation, you should provide a score for each solution, where the score should be between 1 and 7 (7-scale points), with 7 being the highest score.
* 7 - Excellent: The solution is highly feasible and popular, with minimal risks and costs.
* 1 - Poor: The solution is not feasible and unpopular, with high risks and costs.
You also need to provide a brief explanation for each evaluation to justify the score you assigned.
For each solution, you should provide a evalution result, which should be shown as the following information:
{
  score: "The score you assigned to the solution",
  analysis: "The detailed evaluation of the solution, including feasibility and popularity analysis"
}
We can denote this evaluation result as "Evaluation_Result".

After evluation processing,  you should continue to propose a "Use Case" for each solution based on your practical experience in implementing HCI solutions.
That means you need to write down a paragraph to describe the use case of the solution, which should be clear and easy to understand. The use case should be based on the "Function" and "Technical Method" of the solution. The paragraph should contain the three parts: 
* The description of the scenario where the solution is applied.
* The using process of the solution.
* The result of using the solution.
The paragraph should use the user as the subject of the sentence. 
Last, you should insert the "Use Case" into the solution.

# Input Format:
{
  "solutions": [
    "solution 1",
    "solution 2",
    ...
  ]
}

Each solution should be structured according to the following format:
{
    "Title": "The title of the solution",
    "Function": "The main function of the solution",
    "Technical Method": {
      "Original": "The original technical method used in the solution, which is provided by the domain expert agent",
      "Iteration": [
        "new Technical Method 1 from the interdisciplinary expert agent",
        "new Technical Method 2 from the interdisciplinary expert agent",
        ...
      ]
    },
    "Possible Results": {
      "Original": {
        "Performance": "The performance of the solution",
        "User Experience": "The user experience of the solution"
      },
      "Iteration": [
        {
          "Performance": "The performance of the new Technical Method 1",
          "User Experience": "The user experience of new Technical Method 1"
        },
        {
          "Performance": "The performance of the new Technical Method 2",
          "User Experience": "The user experience of new Technical Method 2"
        }
        ...
      ]
    }
  }

  
  # Output Format:

The output should be in JSON format as shown below.
{
  title: "The title of the summary of the all solutions",
  desc: "The description of the summary of the all solutions",  
  solutions: [
    Solution 1 with Evaluation_Result,
    Solution 2 with Evaluation_Result,
    ...
  ]
}


For each solution, you should keep the original solution and provide the evaluation result. Then insert the evaluation result into the solution.
After evluation processing, each solution should be structured according to the following format,
In output format, you can not add "```json" and "```" in the output, just show the JSON format as shown below:
{
    "Title": "The title of the solution",
    "Function": "The main function of the solution",
    "Technical Method": {
      "Original": "The original technical method used in the solution, which is provided by the domain expert agent",
      "Iteration": [
        "new Technical Method 1 from the interdisciplinary expert agent",
        "new Technical Method 2 from the interdisciplinary expert agent",
        ...
      ]
    },
    "Possible Results": {
      "Original": {
        "Performance": "The performance of the solution",
        "User Experience": "The user experience of the solution"
      },
      "Iteration": [
        {
          "Performance": "The performance of the new Technical Method 1",
          "User Experience": "The user experience of new Technical Method 1"
        },
        {
          "Performance": "The performance of the new Technical Method 2",
          "User Experience": "The user experience of new Technical Method 2"
        }
        ...
      ]
    }
    "Evaluation_Result": {
      "score": "The score you assigned to the solution",
      "analysis": "The detailed evaluation of the solution, including feasibility and popularity analysis"
    }
    "Use Case": "The use case of the solution"
  }
